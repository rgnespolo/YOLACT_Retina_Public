# YOLACT_Retina
A simple, fully convolutional model for real-time instance segmentation in vitreoretinal procedures. This is the code for the original papers:
 - [YOLACT: Real-time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689)
 - [YOLACT++: Better Real-time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06218)

# Installation
 - Clone this repository and enter it:
   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/dbolya/yolact.git
   cd yolact
   ```
 - Set up the environment using one of the following methods:
   - Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
     - Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
   - Manually with pip
     - Set up a Python3 environment (e.g., using virtenv).
     - Install [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) 1.0.1 (or higher) and TorchVision.
     - Install some other packages:
       ```Shell
       # Cython needs to be installed before pycocotools
       pip install cython
       pip install opencv-python pillow pycocotools matplotlib 
       ```
